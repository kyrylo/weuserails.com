    <h2>Rails powers the world's best web apps</h2>

    <p>
      "From HELLO WORLD to IPO" isn’t just a catchy slogan — it’s a reality for
      countless companies that have used Ruby on Rails to build and scale their
      products. Since its debut in 2004, Rails has become a favorite among
      developers for its simplicity, productivity, and powerful framework.
