Hey,

Thank you for submitting <%= @site.title %> to WeUseRails.com!

Could you provide some proof that Ruby on Rails is indeed part of your stack?

Sharing a Gemfile (or relevant excerpts) without sensitive information would be
a great way to confirm this. If there’s another way to verify your use of
Rails, feel free to share that instead.

Looking forward to your response!
